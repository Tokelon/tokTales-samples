| ------------ | ----------- | ----- |
| tokTales-samples | A collection of code samples for various use cases. | ![tokTales-samples CI](https://github.com/Tokelon/tokTales-samples/workflows/tokTales-samples%20CI/badge.svg) |

## How to use

These samples are meant to be used for learning about low level functionality in this project and how to implement it in code, using the **[APIs](https://tokelon.github.io/tokTales-docs/)** available.

The samples consist of code snippets that are intended as individual resources and not as one or more collective solutions. For some more complete applications, see **[Demos](https://github.com/Tokelon/tokTales-demos)**.

Because of their limited scope, the samples cannot be guaranteed to work as intended in every scenario. They are intended as pointers on how to go about doing something and not as finished solutions. A default environment setup is assumed in most cases (unless stated otherwise).

For more resources see **[Resource Hub](https://github.com/Tokelon/tokTales/wiki/Resources)**.
